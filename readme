rawssg

About

rawssg is a static site generator (SSG) designed with a focus on UI and UX simplicity. The project draws heavily from other SSG approaches, such as rust-lang/mdbook, which are known for their simplicity, speed, and efficiency.

rawssg doesn't attempt to be a complex framework or full of layers of configuration. Its primary focus is a clean user experience, a clear workflow, and a lightweight, fast-accessible end result.

rawssg's primary goal is to provide a static site creation experience that feels "raw," minimal, and straightforward, without unnecessary distractions.

Philosophy

rawssg wasn't created specifically for developers who want everything instant or "satset." Instead, the project was born from the desire to create an SSG that is truly easy to understand and use for anyone.

Many current SSGs rely too heavily on the same patterns, particularly Markdown-based ones, with nearly identical approaches. rawssg was born out of this saturation.

The vision is simple:

* The UI and UX should be intuitive.
* The content creation process should feel natural.
* The system structure should be transparent.
* Anyone should be able to use it without a painful learning curve.

rawssg is an experiment in deliberate simplicity.

Ecosystem

rawssg is built entirely in Rust. Its architecture is modular and separated by responsibility.

Each part of the system is released as a separate library to maintain flexibility, maintainability, and long-term scalability.

Each part of the system is released as a separate library to maintain flexibility, maintainability, and long-term scalability.

Ecosystem structure:

1. Core Engine
Responsible for the core parsing, build, and orchestration processes.

2. UI/UX Layer
Manages user interactions and the tool experience.

3. Template System
Manages the templating system to ensure flexibility and independent development.

Conclusion

rawssg is a constantly evolving project. Its focus is not on being the most widely used, but on being the one with the clearest direction and purpose.

Simplicity does not mean a lack of features. Simplicity is a design decision.
