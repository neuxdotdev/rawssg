RAWSSG
Static site generator with its own .rw format – raw, minimal, no abstractions.

rawssg is a static site generator written in Rust, focused on clarity, speed, and structural transparency.
No Markdown. No HTML authoring. No abstraction layers. Just write .rw files and build.

Simplicity here is deliberate.

QUICK START

Install:

cargo install rawssg

Create a new site:

rawssg init my-site cd my-site

Write content:

cd content echo "# Hello World" > index.rw

Build:

rawssg build

Serve locally:

rawssg serve

Output is generated inside:

my-site/public/

WHY RAWSSG?

No Markdown, no HTML
rawssg uses a custom .rw syntax designed for clarity and direct structure.
No Markdown edge cases. No HTML clutter.

Zero configuration
You can write .rw files and build immediately. rawssg.toml is optional.

Fast and transparent
Built in Rust with a minimal dependency graph.
No hidden processing layers.

Modular architecture
Each responsibility is separated into independent libraries.

AGPL-3.0
Full freedom to use, study, modify, and distribute.


---

INSTALLATION

Using Cargo:

cargo install rawssg

Or download a pre-built binary from the official releases page and place it in your PATH.


---

PROJECT STRUCTURE

After running:

rawssg init my-site

You get:

my-site/ content/          your .rw files templates/        HTML templates rawssg.toml       optional configuration public/           generated static site

There are no hidden directories.


---

WRITING CONTENT

Example content/index.rw:

title: Homepage date: 2025-02-28

Welcome

This is a paragraph in raw format.

list item one

list item two


The .rw parser converts this into clean static HTML.


---

BUILD PROCESS

Run:

rawssg build

The engine:

1. Parses .rw files


2. Resolves templates


3. Generates static HTML


4. Outputs everything into public/



To preview locally:

rawssg serve

Default local server runs at:

http://localhost:8080

ARCHITECTURE

rawssg is modular by design.

uirawssg
Handles CLI interaction, prompts, logging, and user workflow.

librawssg
Core engine. Parses .rw files, builds structure, orchestrates rendering.

rawssg-templates
Default templates and layout system.

Each library is versioned independently and can evolve separately.


---

ECOSYSTEM

rawssg
Main CLI interface.

librawssg
Core parsing and build engine.

rawssg-templates
Official template collection.

uirawssg
UI and CLI layer.

WHY “RAW”?

rawssg rejects the complexity creep of traditional static site generators.

Instead of layering plugins, themes, and configuration systems, it introduces a clean .rw syntax and a transparent architecture.

Content first.
Structure visible.
No abstraction theater.

rawssg is an experiment in radical simplicity.
