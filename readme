rawssg

About
rawssg is a static site generator (SSG) built around simplicity in both user interface and user experience. Inspired by tools like rust-lang/mdbook, it emphasizes a clean workflow, speed, and efficiency without unnecessary complexity. The goal is to offer a "raw" and straightforward approach to creating static sites—no heavy configuration, no layers of abstraction, just a lightweight and accessible tool.

Philosophy
rawssg was not designed exclusively for developers seeking instant results. It emerged from a desire to build an SSG that anyone can understand and use with ease. Many existing SSGs, especially those relying on Markdown, have grown overly similar and complex. rawssg seeks to break away from that saturation by focusing on:

· Intuitive UI and UX
· A natural content creation process
· Transparent system structure
· A shallow learning curve for all users

rawssg is an experiment in deliberate simplicity.

Ecosystem
Built entirely in Rust, rawssg follows a modular architecture where each responsibility is separated into its own library. This design ensures flexibility, maintainability, and scalability over time.

The ecosystem consists of three core layers:

1. Core Engine – Handles parsing, building, and orchestration.
2. UI/UX Layer – Manages user interactions and the overall tool experience.
3. Template System – Provides a flexible and independently maintainable templating mechanism.

Conclusion
rawssg is an evolving project that prioritizes clarity of purpose over widespread adoption. Simplicity is not a lack of features—it is a conscious design choice.
